# WHAT IS A WEB SERVER

Also known as an HTTP server

The IP address communicates with the server that gives us the data we are asking for (http/https)

# HTTP REQUESTS

-GET (read)
-HEAD
-POST (create)
-PUT (update/replace)
-DELETE
-CONNECT
-OPTIONS
-TRACE
-PATCH (update/modify)

HTTP requests contain a method (i.e., POST), path (i.e., /messages), body (i.e., {text: "hello", photo: "smile.jpg"}), and headers (i.e., Host: facebook.com)

# HTTP RESPONSES

Three main parts: headers (i.e., Content-Type: application/json), body: (i.e., {text: "hi!", photo: "wave.jpg"}), and status code (i.e., https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

# BASICS

Those that follow a certain pattern when building HTTP APIs

Use existing standards of the web (HTTP, JSON, URL)

Use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods to communicate the action we are performing on a collection of data

Only makes sense when we have a client/server architecture

Requests are both stateless and cacheable
